/*

Objective:
Practice using the .length property by calculating the length of
multiple predefined strings and assigning the results to specific variables.

Instructions:
You will be provided with several predefined string variables.
Your task is to:
  - Use the .length property to calculate the length of each string.
  - Assign the length of each string to its corresponding length variable.
  - Ensure that each length variable contains the correct value.

*/

// Starter Code (Pre-filled):
// Predefined strings
let stringOne = "Coding Bootcamp";
let stringTwo = "JavaScript";
let stringThree = "";

// Your task: Assign the length of each string to the corresponding variable
//let lengthOne;   // Length of stringOne
//let lengthTwo;   // Length of stringTwo
//let lengthThree; // Length of stringThree

// Your code here

let lengthOne = stringOne.length;
console.log("The length of the first string: " + stringOne  + " is " + lengthOne);
let lengthTwo = stringTwo.length;
console.log("The length of the second string: " + stringTwo  + " is " + lengthTwo);
let lengthThree = stringThree.length;
console.log("The length of the third string: " + lengthThree);
